Description
    This image was used in an article by P. Perona and J. Malik,
    "Scale-Space Filtering by Anisotropic Diffusions," IEE PAMI.
    Malik digitized the image from a small reproduction of the
    original, which hangs in the National Gallery in Washington,
    D.C. and was painted in Venice by Antonio Canal, nicknamed
    `Canaletto,'' in 1720.
