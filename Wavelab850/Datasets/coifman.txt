Description
    Ronald R. Coifman, Professor of Mathematics at Yale University,
    has developed much of the field that is now known as "adapted
    wavelet analysis."  He has invented, in collaboration with 
    Y. Meyer, wavelet packets and cosine packets, as well as the
    Coifman-Wickerhauser best-basis algorithm.
