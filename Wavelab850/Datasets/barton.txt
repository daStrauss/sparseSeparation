    Supplied by Jan-Olov Stromberg, who used it as the example dataset
    in his article "Image Compression using Franklin Wavelets." In that
    article he uses orthogonal wavelets defined by recursive filtering
    to compress this image by factors of 50 to 1.

    Jan-Olov Stromberg is the original inventor of smooth orthonormal
    Wavelet bases; see his article in the Zygmund Festschrift
